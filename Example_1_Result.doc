
Example of solving ANOVA One- Way table   

The mean life time of batteries is  5.18  hours


In this example, let us frame hypotheses as:

1. H0 (Null): The three types of battery have the same mean life time, estimated by: 5.18  hours.
2. H1 (Alternate): The three types of battery have the different mean life time, estimated by: 5.18  hours. 

Let us use P value to test the null hypothesis that data from all groups are drawn from populations with identical means. 

If the overall P value is large, the data do not give you any reason to conclude that the means differ.

<----------------  ANOVA TABLE ------------>
            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
type         2 0.1692 0.08458    1.39  0.298
Residuals    9 0.5475 0.06083               
<------------------------------------------>
  
From ANOVA test we had performed on the data, we observe that at 95% confidence levelthe probability of selecting a battery type with
Mean life time not same as the standard mean life is: 30.000000%


 Since the p-value is  greater than the significance level of 0.05, we accept the null hypothesis, H0 (Null)


*** Conclusion: The three types of battery have the same mean life time, estimated by  5.18  hours. ***
